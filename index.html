            <h2>Psychology and Sexology</h2>
            <p>First, this essay is about my future career so, when I was a child, people asked me, "What do you want to do when you grow up?” It was until a year ago when I decided to give them an answer that I believe is a decision already made. Therefore, I think that the best career for me is Psychology. It has interested me since I was a child, but I never knew what it was at that time. Moreover, I have always enjoyed learning about the human mind and behavior. As I said before, I like Psychology a lot because it studies the human mind, but I also like it because there are some Psychologists who have inspired me as Margaret Floy Washburn and Melanie Klein. Margaret Floy was a pioneer in her time because she will always be remembered for being the first woman to earn a doctorate, PHD in Psychology, and Melanie Klein was an Austrian Psychologist known for creating a therapeutic technique called "Play Therapy". Her initial intention was to attend medical school, but she became a well-known Psychoanalyst.
Otherwise, Psychologists investigate various aspects of behavior and use that knowledge to provide mental health care to distressed patients. Therefore, I am sure about being a Psychologist. Psychologists offer an ear that is free of judgment and with the purpose of giving a right advice to those with mental health and sexuality problems. Psychologists offer a variety of proven treatments to help people improve their lives. These treatments can be extensive talk therapy, hypnosis, or even medication with the help of the client's doctor. Many people think that working as a Psychology may seem like a basic job, but there are many things that happen inside a human mind, this is the most common name given to the emerging phenomenon that is responsible for understanding, the ability to create thoughts, creativity, learning, reasoning, perception, emotion, memory, imagination, will, and so many other cognitive skills. It is very impressive that psychologists are able to analyze the mind and adequately help people who are struggling with problems or even people who need to talk about how they feel. Life can become overwhelming, so it is important for psychologists to be around and offer a helping hand.
Apart from that career, I want to specialize in sexology, because is "the science that studies human sexuality, sexual behavior and its different manifestations, from the psychological and physiological point of view" and I think that human sexuality shouldn’t be considered a taboo and you can live with the freedom of each one, whether you are a man or a woman, obviously, everything in due time, from another point, I will like to specialize in sexology because I will help victims of sexual abuse. As psychologist, I have to know that exist different types of abuse like sexual abuse that is about to coercing or attempting to coerce any sexual contact or behavior without consent, Physical abuse that consists hitting, slapping, shoving, grabbing, pinching, biting, hair pulling, etc. Psychological abuse happens when one partner, through a series of actions or words, wears away at the other’s sense of mental wellbeing and health, cultural abuse that happens when abusers use aspects of a victim’s particular cultural identity to inflict suffering and economic abuse
In conclusion, I am sure that being a psychologist is my passion because I know what it's like to feel trapped in a bubble of emotions or insecurity, that's why I want to help people who suffer from mental problems whether due to insecurity, low self-esteem or sexual abuse, moreover want to specialize in sexology, for to be a great support for victims of sexual abuse or trauma due to abuse and to raise awareness of the mental damage that rape, harassment, and gender violence can cause.
I plan to study psychology at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, because that university is very good in the field of mental health, and it makes it easier for me to study in Spain because I am Spanish.
